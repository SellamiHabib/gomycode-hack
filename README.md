## Description
This repo contains the prototype of part 3 of our presentation in which we introduced improvements

#### Proposed features :

- A project leaderboard on each checkpoint to increase competitiveness among students and to inspire others.
- Each featured project has a link to the github repo and a hosted static website, we had a disscussion to see if we could automaticly host github repos using github pages but we decided that we are short on time.

- An optional feedback popup that gets shown in the middle of the course instead of the current way, which is at the end. This solves issues as soon as they arise, so they the instructor or the course creator can fix them asap, and it can be more developed to solve an issue brought by instructors, which is low ratings given by students who don't attend and shouldn't be eligible to rate their instructors.
- A badges/achievments system, that can be displayed on the student's profile and shared in social media. Each badge gives points.
- The points mentioned above, are to be merged with the current points system implemeted by gomycode platform. They can be later redeemed to get coupons and many other perks.
